You can add your **own** materials. If you want to add an assignment contact the professor first to ask for permission. Send proof to [Stefano Vazzoler (stefanovazzocell@gmail.com)](mailto:stefanovazzocell@gmail.com) before adding anything.

## Takedown / Copyright

### University

Are you a professor, course coordinator, university admin, or some other representative thereof that would like to request some material to be removed?

Ask yourself: do I (or someone I reppresent) own the material? Do I have the rights to request some material to be removed?

I will remove homeworks, problem sets, labs, midterms, exams, and any similar material.

I will not remove student's notes, student's cheatsheets, or any material originating from students since it's not owned by the course or uni (unless special circumstances apply).

### Notes Author

If you have access to the repository, you can remove your own notes. If you don't have access but you would still like to remove your own notes, contact me.

### Other

In any other case contact me.
